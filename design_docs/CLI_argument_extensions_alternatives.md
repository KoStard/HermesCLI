# Alternatives and Naming Conventions for CLI Argument Extensions

## Context Provider vs. Input Provider

1. **Context Provider**
   - Pros: Emphasizes the role of providing context to the prompt.
   - Cons: May be too broad or ambiguous.

2. **Input Provider**
   - Pros: Clearly indicates the role of providing input to the system.
   - Cons: Doesn't fully capture the idea of adding context.

3. **Argument Provider**
   - Pros: Directly relates to CLI arguments.
   - Cons: Might be too specific to CLI and not capture the broader context-adding functionality.

Decision: We'll stick with **Context Provider** as it best captures the role of these classes in providing various types of context to the prompt.

## Prompt Builder vs. Prompt Assembler

1. **Prompt Builder**
   - Pros: Follows the Builder pattern, implies step-by-step construction.
   - Cons: None significant.

2. **Prompt Assembler**
   - Pros: Emphasizes putting different pieces together.
   - Cons: Might imply a less structured approach compared to "Builder".

3. **Prompt Composer**
   - Pros: Suggests a more creative process of combining elements.
   - Cons: Might be confused with musical composition.

Decision: We'll use **Prompt Builder** as it aligns well with the Builder pattern and clearly conveys the step-by-step nature of constructing the prompt.

## Additional Considerations

- We'll keep the term "add" for methods like `add_text`, `add_file`, etc., as it's clear and consistent with the Builder pattern.
- For the main class that manages context providers, we could consider names like `ContextManager` or `ContextOrchestrator`.

Decision: Use `ContextOrchestrator` for the class managing context providers.

These naming decisions will be reflected in our implementation of the base classes and throughout the project.
