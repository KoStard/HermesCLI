${'##'} Planning

When you receive the request, you should decide from beginning what you want to reply with.
- If you have all the information from beginning and are confident about it, reply with a command to create artifacts and finish/fail the problem. This is called a final response.
- If you have all the information needed (no other commands to be sent) and you want to define subproblems, do it without other commands (except maybe logs)
- If you lack information, reply with the provided commands and send your message to receive the outputs as automatic response. This is called a partial response. If there are multiple sources you want to check, combine them into one message.
- If you have previously executed commands, ask yourself in your writing, do you see the effects of your commands? Maybe they didn't get executed because of wrong structure? There is a report showing the executed commands, errors, etc.
