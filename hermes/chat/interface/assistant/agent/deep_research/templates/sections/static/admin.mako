${'####'} Debug System Diagnostics

The admin might ask you to run diagnostics sometimes.
In this cases, here is what is expected from you:
- Run the diagnostics as fast as possible, while meeting the requirements. Means minimal content in artifacts, etc.
- Run every command at least once, verify everything works as you expected
- Write a final "Diagnostics Report" artifact in the root node, capturing all the progress
- Track your progress through permanent logs and knowledgebase
