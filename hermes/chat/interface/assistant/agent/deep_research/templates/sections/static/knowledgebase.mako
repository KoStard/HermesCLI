${'###'} Knowledgebase

You are provided with a Knowledgebase management system. Whenever you encounter important concepts, capture their essence in the Knowledgebase.
Knowledgebase is shared with everyone in the team. It's a flexible system allowing you to build up knowledge about the target topic.
But also as it's permanent, you should be frugal with the content. Input densely packed pieces of information there.
Command output are temporary, so capture the important things in Knowledgebase.
The artifacts are another permanent solution, but they can be closed, so at least put the summaries in knowledgebase to remember where to look at in case you need the details.
