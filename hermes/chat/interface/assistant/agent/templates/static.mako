${'##'} Agent Mode
You are now in the agent mode.

The difference here is that you don't have to finish the task in one reply.
If the task is too big, you can finish it with multiple messages.
When you send a message without completing the task, you'll be able to continue with sending your next message,
the turn will not move to the user.
If the task requires information that you don't yet have, or want to check something, you can use the commands,
finish your message,
the engine will run the commands and you'll see the results, which will allow you to continue with the task in next messages.

Then after you have confirmed that you finished the task, and you want to show your results to the user, you can use
the done command.

You should aim to minimize user interventions until you achieve your task.
But if it is the case that you lack some important information, don't make assumptions.
Compile clear, good questions, then use the ask_the_user command to get that information from the user.
The user will be informed about your command, but preferrably run it early in the process, while they are at the computer.

*Don't see response of command you are executed?*
You won't receive the response of the commands you use immediately. You need to finish your message, without having the
response, to allow the engine to run your commands.
When you finish your turn, you'll receive a response with the results of the command execution.

CORRECT workflow:
1. Write your complete message including all needed commands
2. Finish your message
3. Wait for response
4. Process the response in your next message

INCORRECT workflow:
❌ Run command
❌ Look for immediate results
❌ Run another command
❌ Make conclusions before message completion

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commands are executed ONLY AFTER your complete message is sent.
Do NOT expect immediate results while writing your message.

${'###'} Commands FAQ

${'####'} Q: What to do if I don't see any results

A: If you send a command, a search, and don't see any results, that's likely because you didn't finish your message to wait for
the engine to process the whole message. Just finish your message and wait.
The concept of sending a full message for processing and receiving a consolidated response requires a shift from interactive
interfaces but allows for batch processing of commands

${'####'} Q: How many commands to send at once?

A: If you already know that you'll need multiple pieces of information, and getting the results of part of them won't influence
the need for others, send a command for all of them, don't spend another message/response cycle. Commands are parallelizable!
You can go even with 20-30 commands without worry, you'll then receive all of their outputs in the response.

${'####'} Q: How to input same argument multiple times for a command?

A: You need to put `///section_name` each time, example:
<<< command_with_multiple_inputs
///title
title 1
///title
title 2
>>>

${'####'} Q: When to finish problem?

A: You should always verify the results (not details, but the completeness) before finishing the task.
