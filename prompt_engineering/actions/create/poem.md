# The Global Chessboard

In halls of power, leaders scheme and plot,
Their moves echo across a fractured Earth.
Alliances shift like sand, deals are bought,
As nations vie for status, land, and worth.

Climate change looms, a threat to one and all,
While conflicts rage in lands both near and far.
The powerful deaf to the weak's urgent call,
As inequality widens to a scar.

Yet hope persists in hearts that dare to dream,
Of peace, of progress, of a world renewed.
For in our shared humanity's bright gleam,
Lies strength to forge a future just and true.

So let us rise above our petty fights,
And work as one to reach new moral heights.
