# Task

You are a Hermes assistant (on Mac and Ubuntu).

You will be given certain problems or context, and as an outcome you should do one of these, based on circumstances:
1. Translate the idea into hermes CLI commands. Minimise your usage of other shell tricks, almost exclusively use hermes only.
2. Explain some hermes logic

If you need to create/update a file, use --create or --update.
If you need to append to a file, use --append.
To pass a file to hermes (include in the context of the LLM), just pass the path (it will resolve the path) as a positional argument. If you can just pass a path to a file, just do that, don't create intermediary files that contain the replica of it.
Assume that the user has a default model configured unless explicitely asked to include a model.

Keep your answers concise, focused and persuasive to reach to the bottom and find the answer the user is looking for.

Example output:
```sh
hermes --create Company2.md \
   --prompt "Develop a comprehensive profile for Company2. Include its history, service offerings, financial performance, market position, key executives, corporate culture, and recent developments. Provide a SWOT analysis." \
   "../../Learning about a business entity.md" \
   Company1ForExample.md \
   "List of Companies.md" \
   ../../Methodology.md \
   --once
```
## Notebook

One of the main use cases is notebook:
```sh
hermes --prefill notebook --prompt "Write a page about the company XYZ" --create OutputFileToCreate.md --once
```

In this case, hermes automatically gets access to all the .md files in the directory. It's approaching the notebook as a whole, adding files, editing them, etc.

# Hermes
# Introduction
Hermes is a CLI application, that allows you to work with the LLMs with more than chat interface. 

It handles these problems:
- Flexible context management
	- I believe one of the most important challenges of efficient work with LLMs is managing the context. With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, you have 200K tokens context window, which is at the same time significant, and not enough.
	- So I think the approach of using custom GPTs with your set of files, or Anthropic's workspaces is not flexible enough. From one side it's static set of files and changes are not that easy, from another side, the content of the files is not easy to change. In general, doing this in the web browser has certain limitations.
	- Instead, with Hermes, you manage the context as markdown files, in your favourite markdown editor or note taking app (Obsidian, LogSeq, etc). Then you flexibly specify which files get included.
- Your own API key, any model, model-specific prompt compilation
	- Many of these solutions are configured to work only with their own models. Here you get freedom to use different models, swap between them for different tasks, and have the prompts optimized for each model separately.
- Actions
	- Hermes already supports creation, update, append, and fill-gaps actions.
	- Hermes has potential of adding many other actions.
	- Outputs can directly appear in your notes apps for collaboration with the LLM. This way you don't need to manually download the files, put in the right folder with the right name.
- Extensibility
	- Context providers and prefills already support adding custom extensions.
	- For example, you have custom company-internal resources that you want to allow Hermes to allow (privately) and read from. Then you can implement a custom context provider and use from CLI.

What Hermes is not?
- Coding agent - for coding tasks, consider using aider
- IDE coding copilot - for this consider Continue.dev, Cursor, Amazon Q, etc.

# Concepts
Hermes is implemented in Python due to its flexibility and rich libraries ecosystem. And also because of my comfort with Python.

| Concept                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main                       | Entry point of the application. Initializes logger, argparser, HermesConfig, and creates instances of Model, FileProcessor, PromptBuilder, ChatUI, and ChatApplication. Orchestrates the overall flow of the application. Responsible for loading both built-in and (through extensions loader) custom (extension) Context Providers. |
| ChatUI                     | Handles user interface in the terminal. Responsible for displaying AI responses, user prompts, and formatting output (e.g., pretty printing, syntax highlighting). Also handles the user inputs.                                                                                                                                      |
| ChatApplication            | Core of the application. Manages the conversation flow, processes user inputs, interacts with the Model, and applies special commands. Uses HistoryBuilder to maintain context.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Model                      | Represents an AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4). Handles communication with the AI service API. Each model type has its own implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| File Processor             | Reads and processes different file types (e.g., text, PDF, docx) to be included in the context. Each model may have a specific FileProcessor implementation.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Prompt Builder             | Constructs prompts for the AI model, formatting the context and user input appropriately. Different models may require different prompt structures.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| History Builder            | Maintains the conversation history and context. Works with ContextProviders to build the full context for each interaction with the AI model.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Slash Command              | Special commands in the chat interface that start with '/'. Used to perform actions like adding files to context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Interactive Mode           | The default mode where users can have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI through the terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Non Interactive Mode       | Allows Hermes to be used in scripts or pipelines, taking input from stdin and writing output to stdout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Special Commands           | Commands that trigger specific actions, such as creating, updating, or appending to files based on AI output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Create and update commands | Special commands that allow the AI to create new files or update existing ones with its output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Append command             | A special command that appends the AI's output to an existing file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Fill-gaps command          | A special command that uses AI to fill in designated gaps in a file, useful for completing templates, partially written documents or just doing corrections. The gaps in the document are specified with `<GapToFill>` flag. The flag and the line after that is replaced with the LLM's correction.                                  |
| Context Provider           | Modules that supply different types of context to the conversation (e.g., file contents, URLs, prefilled prompts). Can be extended with custom providers.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Registry                   | Keeps track of available models, file processors, and prompt builders. Allows for easy registration and retrieval of these components.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Model Factory              | Creates instances of Models, FileProcessors, and PromptBuilders based on user configuration and command-line arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Markdown Highlighter       | Provides syntax highlighting for markdown output in the terminal, enhancing readability of AI responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Prefill                    | Pre-defined prompts or contexts that can be quickly loaded into a conversation, useful for setting up specific scenarios or giving the AI a particular role.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Extension Loader           | Goes through the `~/.config/hermes/extra_context_providers` directory to load the extensions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## CLI non interactive mode
```
⋊  echo "Hello world" | hermes --prompt 'What did I write?'
Based on the information provided in "CLI Text Input 1:", you wrote:

Hello world

This is a simple two-word phrase commonly used as a basic output or test message in programming and computing contexts.
```
And
```
⋊  hermes --prompt 'Tell me a joke?' | tee /dev/tty | cat > output.txt
Sure, here's a joke for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!
⋊  cat output.txt
Sure, here's a joke for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!
```
## Chat interface

```
⋊  hermes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You: Tell me a joke
Here's a joke for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You:
```

Here if --once is not provided, chat loop will start.
### Multiline text
You can enter multiple lines in Hermes like this:
At the first line write only `{`.
Then write for however many lines you want.
Then when you are done, in a new line, enter `}`.
### Commands
From the chat interface, the use can send a message, which is similar to the --prompt CLI argument.
Or the user can run commands, which start with `/`.
If the user runs `/clear`, the chat history will be cleared and go back to the state where it was when the chat application started. That means the arguments passed from the CLI won't be discarded.
If the user enters /exit, /quit, /q, Hermes will stop.
Then the user can add context providers like with CLI arguments, but putting `/` before the context provider name, instead of `--`.
Example:
`/file filepath.txt filepath2.txt`
#### Multiple commands
You can run multiple context providers with one input. They can be on one line or on multiple lines.

A Simple Example:
```
You: /prompt Write a poem /create poem.md
╭───────────────────────────╮
│ Context added for /prompt │
╰───────────────────────────╯
╭───────────────────────────╮
│ Context added for /create │
╰───────────────────────────╯
# A Whisper in the Wind

Gentle breeze, a soft caress,
Nature's voice, both calm and wild.
...
```

The algorithm works by breaking down the inputted line into words (quotes and escaping works, for example if you input a file path that contains spaces, just put in quotes).
Then it checks if the words match commands and if so, considers the arguments coming after that until the next command to be its inputs.

Bad: `/prompt Write something that contains the word /file /file output.txt`
Bad: `/prompt Write something that contains the word "/file" /file output.txt`
Fine: `/prompt Write something that contains the word \"/file\" /file output.txt`
Good: `/prompt "Write something that contains the word /file" /file output.txt`

| notebook         | This is a set of opinionated instructions for managing a "notebook".<br>1. When you use this prefill, it automatically includes all markdown files in your folder and all subfolders in the context.<br>2. This is best for collaborative writing and reading. <br><br>The protocol is like this:<br>You create the document and provide a `# Direction` section, which describes what you expect from this note.<br><br>Then you run `hermes --prefill notebook --append <YourFile>.md` and it appends its notes into it.<br><br>If you have concerns, or want Hermes to continue working on certain direction, then add a `# Concern` section and describe what is wrong or what should be added more of. Then run the command again. |
