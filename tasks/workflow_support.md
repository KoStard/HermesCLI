# Hermes Workflow Support

## Overview
This sub-project aims to enhance Hermes by adding support for workflows, allowing users to define and execute complex, multi-step AI interactions and tasks.

## Requirements and Goals

1. **Workflow Definition**
   - Implement support for defining workflows using YAML files
   - Allow users to describe multiple steps in a workflow
   - Support different types of tasks, including LLM interactions and shell commands

2. **Workflow Execution**
   - Develop a system to execute workflows defined in YAML files
   - Implement a mechanism to pass context and outputs between workflow steps
   - Support both global context and task-specific context

3. **CLI Integration**
   - Enhance the CLI to support workflow execution
   - Implement a command like `hermes --workflow MyWorkflow inputs`
   - Allow seamless integration of CLI inputs into workflow steps

4. **Workflow Repository**
   - Create a central repository for storing workflow files
   - Implement automatic detection of workflow files by the CLI tool

5. **Progress Reporting**
   - Develop a high-quality progress reporting system for the CLI
   - Provide clear and informative updates during workflow execution

6. **Context Management**
   - Implement a system for managing different levels of context
   - Support global context accessible throughout the workflow
   - Enable passing of context and outputs between individual tasks

7. **Task Types**
   - Support LLM model interactions as workflow tasks
   - Implement shell command execution as part of workflows
   - Allow for easy extension to support additional task types in the future

8. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Implement robust error handling for workflow execution
   - Provide options for workflow recovery or continuation after errors

9. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for defining and using workflows
   - Provide example workflows to demonstrate capabilities and best practices

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - Develop a suite of tests for the workflow system
    - Implement validation for workflow YAML files

## Implementation Strategy

1. Design the YAML structure for defining workflows
2. Implement basic workflow parsing and execution
3. Integrate workflow support into the existing CLI structure
4. Develop context management system
5. Implement progress reporting for workflows
6. Add support for shell command execution in workflows
7. Create the central workflow repository and detection system
8. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
9. Write documentation and create example workflows
10. Develop comprehensive testing suite

## Future Enhancements

- GUI for workflow creation and management
- Support for conditional branching in workflows
- Integration with external tools and APIs
- Workflow sharing and collaboration features
