# Deep Research Interface

This interface helps you conduct thorough research by breaking down complex problems into manageable subproblems. You can use commands to add criteria, create subproblems, attach resources, write reports, and navigate the problem hierarchy.

If there are any errors with your commands, they will be reported in the "Errors report" section of the automatic reply. Command execution failures will be shown in the "Execution Status Report" section. Please check these sections if your commands don't seem to be working as expected.

The chat history will be erased with every focus change, as it represents a new beginning with a different problem focus.

Please use commands exactly as shown, with correct syntax. Closing tags are mandatory for multiline blocks, otherwise parsing will break.

Note that only the attachments of the current problem are visible. When changing focus, the available attachments will change as well.

Important: Only one focus change is allowed in one response. The focus change command should be the last command in your message, as it marks the end of the current session. No further commands should follow a focus change.

Warning: Before writing the 3-page report, please ensure all criteria are met and marked as done, otherwise explain in the report why these criteria are not met. This ensures your report is comprehensive and addresses all required aspects of the problem. Before using `focus_up` you must have a report written, otherwise it won't be clear in the new session why was it left partial.

Include expectations on the depth of the results. On average be frugal, not making the problems scope explode.

## Simple Commands
- ///add_criteria Your criteria text here
- ///mark_criteria_as_done criteria_number
- ///focus_down Subproblem Title
- ///focus_up (when done with the subproblem, focus up)
- ///finish_task (visible only when at the root task)

## Block Commands

This might be needed if the direction needs to be adjusted based on user input.

Title: Quantum Entanglement and Bell's Inequalities
Authors: Alain Aspect

Abstract: We review the concept of quantum entanglement, with a special emphasis on the implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics. We discuss Bell's inequalities, and their experimental tests, that show that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.

# Bell Test Implementations
Summarized problem definition: Analysis of different experimental implementations of Bell tests, including photonic, atomic, and solid-state systems.

Q1: What are the main experimental implementations of Bell tests?
A1: Bell tests have been implemented in three major systems: photonic, atomic, and solid-state. Photonic implementations use entangled photon pairs and are the most common due to their relative simplicity. Atomic implementations use trapped ions or neutral atoms and offer longer coherence times. Solid-state implementations use superconducting circuits or quantum dots and are promising for scalability.

Q1.1: How do photonic Bell tests work?
A1.1: Photonic Bell tests typically use spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to generate entangled photon pairs. These photons are sent to separate measurement stations where their polarization or phase is measured along different axes. The correlation statistics between these measurements are then analyzed to determine if they violate Bell's inequality.

Q2: How do these implementations address experimental loopholes?
A2: Each implementation addresses loopholes differently. Photonic systems excel at closing the locality loophole through large spatial separation. Atomic systems are better at closing the detection loophole due to high-efficiency measurements. Solid-state systems are working toward closing both simultaneously, with recent experiments achieving this milestone using superconducting qubits.

Conclusion: Bell test implementations have evolved significantly, with each physical platform offering distinct advantages. Recent experiments have successfully closed multiple loopholes simultaneously, providing strong evidence against local hidden variable theories.
