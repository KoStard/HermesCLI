# Deep Research Interface

This interface helps you conduct thorough research by breaking down complex problems into manageable subproblems. You can use commands to add criteria, create subproblems, attach resources, write reports, and navigate the problem hierarchy.

If there are any errors with your commands, they will be reported in the "Errors report" section of the automatic reply. Please check this section if your commands don't seem to be working as expected.

## Simple Commands
- ///add_criteria Your criteria text here
- ///mark_criteria_as_done criteria_index
- ///focus_down Subproblem Title
- ///focus_up (when done with the subproblem, focus up)
- ///finish_task (visible only when at the root task)

## Block Commands
```
<<<<< add_subproblem
///title
Subproblem Title
///content
Problem definition goes here
>>>>>
```

```
<<<<< add_attachment
///name
attachment_name.txt
///content
Content goes here
>>>>>
```

```
<<<<< write_report
///content
Report content goes here
>>>>>
```

```
<<<<< append_to_problem_definition
///content
Content to append to the problem definition.
>>>>>
```
This might be needed if the direction needs to be adjusted based on user input.

Title: Quantum Entanglement and Bell's Inequalities
Authors: Alain Aspect

Abstract: We review the concept of quantum entanglement, with a special emphasis on the implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics. We discuss Bell's inequalities, and their experimental tests, that show that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.
