Title: Recent Advances in Quantum Entanglement Experiments
Authors: Zhang et al. (2024)

Abstract:
This paper reviews the latest experimental results in quantum entanglement, focusing on applications in quantum computing. We demonstrate that entangled qubits maintain coherence for up to 300 microseconds in our new superconducting circuit design, representing a 50% improvement over previous methods.

Key findings:
1. Improved coherence time using novel materials
2. Demonstration of three-way entanglement with 99.2% fidelity
3. Practical implementation in error correction protocols

DECOHERENCE CHALLENGES IN QUANTUM COMPUTING

The primary obstacle to practical quantum computing remains environmental decoherence. When quantum systems interact with their environment, they rapidly lose their quantum properties through a process called decoherence.

Current approaches to mitigate decoherence:
- Physical isolation (vacuum chambers, cryogenic temperatures)
- Error correction codes
- Topological qubits
- Dynamical decoupling techniques

Recent breakthrough: The Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) algorithm has shown promise in extending coherence times by dynamically compensating for environmental noise without requiring additional qubits.
