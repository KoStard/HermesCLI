- configuration yaml/toml file
- interactive history chooser
- allow modifying the history, going back, changing if something is permanent
- diff generation and application? To update files
- checkpoints in history to easily go back
- add extension installation and uninstallation commands, manage it from here
- proper exception handling - Ctrl+c in some random moment should not break the app, but just bring the control back to the user - the participants are not equal
- proper logging


- The history handling is wrong for the LLM
